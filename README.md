I am **Alejandro Medina**. I graduated from Southwestern University in three years with a BS in Computer Science and Minors in Mathematics and Data Science. I am currently a fully funded PhD student program at Baylor University. I enjoy reading, listening to music, and working out. I have participated in various undergrad research opportunities, and have even presented at an international conference! Something interesting about me is that I was one of four undergraduate students to be nationally recognized and awarded the 2024 Computing Research Association's Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award! I have also been recognized within Southwestern's CS/Math department with the Grogan Lord Award in Computer Science. This is issued to the single-most outstanding student in the department of the year. Outside of CS, I have been recognized by Southwestern with the Five Points of Pride award, which is awarded to the top five most outstanding senior's of the year (I was the selected outstanding student for all of the Natural Sciences for 2024).
