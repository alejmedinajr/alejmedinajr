I am **Alejandro Medina**. I am currently attending Southwestern University for a bachelor's of science in Computer Science. I enjoy reading, listening to music, and working out. I have participated in various undergrad research opportunities, and have even presented at an international conference! Currently, I am collaborating on an app that focuses on helping teens ween off of nicotine addiction. I am also currently collaborating on a reaserach paper that focuses on the **[SCOPE](https://youtu.be/7jYzZO0z2-0)** Summer Research I did through my university. This research focused on using quality diversity algorithms in Minecraft to evolve flying machines!
