I am **Alejandro Medina**. I am currently attending Southwestern University for a bachelor's of science in Computer Science. I enjoy reading, listening to music, and working out. I have participated in various undergrad research opportunities, and have even presented at an international conference! Something interesting about me is that I was one of four undergraduate students to be nationally recognized and awarded the 2024 Computing Research Association's Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award!
